                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
 the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
 License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

 0. Additional Definitions.

 As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
 GNU General Public License.

 “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
 other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

 An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
 by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
 Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
 of using an interface provided by the Library.

 A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
 Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
 with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
 Version”.

 The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
 Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
 for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
 based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

 The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
 object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
 and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
 Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

 You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
 without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

 2. Conveying Modified Versions.

 If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
 facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
 that uses the modified version, you must make a good faith effort to
 ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
 function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever
 part of its purpose remains meaningful.

 3. Object code incorporating material from library header files.

 The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
 a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
 code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
 material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
 layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
 (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.

 4. Combined Works.

 You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
 taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the parts
 of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering
 for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
      the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
      these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
      copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
          and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
          and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink
          the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version
          to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified
          by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
          a copy of the Library already present on the user’s computer
          system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
          of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
          Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
      be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
      GNU GPL, and only to the extent that you must do so for the Combined
      Work to be installable and executable by the user.  (If you use
      option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
      Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.)

 5. Combined Libraries.

 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
 side by side in a single library together with other library facilities
 not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under
 terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the combined library
      that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use
      are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.

 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new
 versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/> for details.

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
 Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that published
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a version number of the
 GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version ever
 published by the Free Software Foundation.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 This Library is provided to you as-is, without any warranty of any
 kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the
 implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
 purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
 Library is with you.  Should the Library prove defective, you assume
 the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

 8. Limitation of Liability.

 In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
 will any Copyright Holder, or any other party who modifies and/or
 conveys the Library as permitted above, be liable to you for damages,
 including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages
 arising out of the use or inability to use the Library (including but
 not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses
 sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Library to operate
 with any other software), even if such holder or other party has been
 advised of the possibility of such damages.

                        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
                       DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 0. This License Agreement applies to any library or other program
    which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
    authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called “this License”).
    Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library’s
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
    that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 4
    provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
       facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
       invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event the Application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
       of its purpose remains meaningful.
